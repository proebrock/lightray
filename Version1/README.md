# LightRay: Version 1

## Schematics

The laser used is the Picotronic MD650-1-5(12x34), a laser module with a wavelength of 650nm and an optical power of 1mW (Laser class I). The laser beam focus is adjustable. It is powered with 5V and 22mA and has a separate modulation input with a frequency of up to 100kHz. Further details can be found on the manufacturer's website [here](https://www.picotronic.de/picopage/en/product/detail/id/2566). It can be ordered from Conrad under order number [1283358-62](https://www.conrad.ch/de/lasermodul-punkt-rot-1-mw-picotronic-md650-1-512x34-1283358.html).

The light sensitive element is a photo diode Everlight PD333-3C/H0/L2. It is fast and the range of spectral bandwidth is from 400nm to 1100nm. Further details can be found on the manufacturer's website [here](http://www.everlight.com/file/ProductFile/PD333-3C-H0-L2.pdf). It can be ordered from Conrad under order number [156409-62](https://www.conrad.ch/de/fotodiode-5-mm-1200-nm-everlight-opto-pd333-3chol2-156409.html).

The schematics is straight forward. Using an Arduino Uno the laser module can be directly fixed attached to the Arduino. On the receiver side the photo diode is used in reverse direction with a pullup resistor.

The electrical signal on the receiver side is pretty strong. The pulse width used was 500Âµs and sender and receiver were just some centimeters apart.
