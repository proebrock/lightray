# LightRay

In this project I am trying to learn something about transferring data by modulating light. The light source may be a laser or a LED. The receiving element is a photo diode. Special about this data transmission is that it is uni-directional, so the receiver cannot tell the sender about an faulty or missing data package, except if you add another communication channel. There is a lot of work done in this field, for an overview see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Fi).

I will test different hardware and software implementations. Here is a list:

* [Version 1](Version1/README.md)
* [Version 2](Version2/README.md)
